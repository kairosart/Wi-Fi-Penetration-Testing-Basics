Airodump-ng serves as a tool for capturing packets, specifically targeting raw 802.11 frames. Its primary function lies in the collection of WEP IVs (Initialization Vectors) or WPA/WPA2 handshakes, which are subsequently utilized with aircrack-ng for security assessment purposes.

Furthermore, airodump-ng generates multiple files containing comprehensive information regarding all identified access points and clients. These files can be harnessed for scripting purposes or the development of personalized tools.

`airodump-ng` provides a wealth of information when scanning for WiFi networks. The table below explains each field along with its description:

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`BSSID`|Shows the MAC address of the access points|
|`PWR`|Shows the "power" of the network. The higher the number, the better the signal strength.|
|`Beacons`|Shows the number of announcement packets sent by the network.|
|`#Data`|Shows the number of captured data packets.|
|`#/s`|Shows the number of data packets captured in the past ten seconds.|
|`CH`|Shows the "Channel" the network runs on.|
|`MB`|Shows the maximum speed supported by the network.|
|`ENC`|Shows the encryption method used by the network.|
|`CIPHER`|Shows the cipher used by the network.|
|`AUTH`|Shows the authentication used by the network.|
|`ESSID`|Shows the name of the network.|
|`STATION`|Shows the MAC address of the client connected to the network.|
|`RATE`|Shows the data transfer rate between the client and the access point.|
|`LOST`|Shows the number of data packets lost.|
|`Packets`|Shows the number of data packets sent by the client.|
|`Notes`|Shows additional information about the client, such as captured EAPOL or PMKID.|
|`PROBES`|Shows the list of networks the client is probing for.|

To utilize airodump-ng effectively, the first step is to activate `monitor mode` on the wireless interface. This mode allows the interface to capture all the wireless traffic in its vicinity. We can use `airmon-ng` to enable monitor mode on the interface, as shown in the previous section.

```shell
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```

![[airodump-ng1.png]]

Once Monitor mode is enabled, we can run `airodump-ng` by specifying the name of the targeted wireless interface, such as `airodump-ng wlan0mon`. This command prompts airodump-ng to start scanning and collecting data on the wireless access points detectable by the specified interface.

The output generated by `airodump-ng wlan0mon` will present a structured table containing detailed information about the identified wireless access points.

```shell
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

![[airodump-ng2.png]]

From the above output, we can see that there are three available WiFi networks or access points (APs): `NETGEAR`, `bigbear`, and `teddy`. NETGEAR has the BSSID `00:09:5B:1C:AA:1D` and uses OPN (open) encryption. Bigbear has the BSSID `00:14:6C:7A:41:81` and uses WEP encryption. Teddy has the BSSID `00:14:6C:7E:40:80` and uses WPA encryption.

The stations shown below represent the clients connected to the WiFi network. By checking the station ID along with the BSSID, we can determine which client is connected to which WiFi network. For example, the client with station ID `00:0F:B5:FD:FB:C2` is connected to the `teddy` network.

## Scanning Specific Channels or a Single Channel

The command `airodump-ng wlan0mon` initiates a comprehensive scan, collecting data on wireless access points across all the `channels` available. However, we can specify a particular channel using the `-c` option to focus the scan on a specific frequency. For instance, `-c 11` would narrow the scan to `channel 11`. This targeted approach can provide more refined results, especially in crowded Wi-Fi environments.

Example of a single channel:

```shell
sudo airodump-ng -c 11 wlan0mon
```

It is also possible to select multiple channels for scanning using the command `airodump-ng -c 1,6,11 wlan0mon`.

## Scanning 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands

By default, airodump-ng is configured to scan exclusively for networks operating on the 2.4 GHz band. Nevertheless, if the wireless adapter is compatible with the 5 GHz band, we can instruct airodump-ng to include this frequency range in its scan by utilizing the `--band` option. You can find a list of all WLAN channels and bands available for Wi-Fi [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels).

The supported bands are a, b, and g.

- `a` uses 5 GHz
- `b` uses 2.4 GHz
- `g` uses 2.4 GHz

```shell
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --band a
```

![[airodump-ng4.png]]

When employing the `--band` option, we have the flexibility to specify either a single band or a combination of bands according to our scanning needs. For instance, to scan across all available bands, we can execute the command `airodump-ng --band abg wlan0mon`. This command instructs airodump-ng to scan for networks across the `a`, `b`, and `g` bands simultaneously, providing a comprehensive overview of the wireless landscape accessible to the specified wireless interface, wlan0mon.

## Saving the output to a file

We can preserve the outcomes of our `airodump-ng` scan by utilizing the `--write <prefix>` parameter. This action generates multiple files with the specified prefix filename. For instance, executing `airodump-ng wlan0mon --write HTB` will generate the following files in the current directory.

- HTB-01.cap
- HTB-01.csv
- HTB-01.kismet.csv
- HTB-01.kismet.netxml
- HTB-01.log.csv

```shell
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -w HTB
```

![[airodump-ng5.png]]

Every time airodump-ng is executed with the command to capture either IVs (Initialization Vectors) or complete packets, it generates additional text files that are saved onto the disk. These files share the same name with the original output and are differentiated by suffixes: *".csv"* for CSV files, *".kismet.csv"* for Kismet CSV files, and *".kismet.netxml"* for Kismet newcore netxml files. These generated files serve different purposes, facilitating diverse forms of data analysis and compatibility with various network analysis tools.

```shell
ls
```

## Moving On

In the next section, we'll explore how to interpret these files visually, allowing us to observe the available Access Points (APs) and clients in a graphical representation. This visual analysis enhances our understanding of the network environment by presenting data in a more intuitive format.

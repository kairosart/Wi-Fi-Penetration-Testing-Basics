[Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) comprises a comprehensive suite of tools designed for the evaluation of WiFi network security. Prior to initiating any endeavors to analyze or exploit wireless networks, a foundational understanding of the functionalities inherent within these tools is imperative.

Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

- `Monitoring`: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
- `Attacking`: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
- `Testing`: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
- `Cracking`: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).

All tools within Aircrack-ng operate through command-line interfaces, facilitating extensive scripting capabilities. This attribute has been leveraged by numerous graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Aircrack-ng predominantly functions on Linux platforms but extends compatibility to Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and even eComStation 2.

The Aircrack-ng suite encompasses over 20 tools tailored for auditing Wi-Fi networks. We'll concentrate on the six most frequently utilized and essential tools within the suite. These tools are indispensable for various Wi-Fi security auditing tasks and are commonly sought after by users seeking comprehensive network assessment and protection.

| **Tool**      | **Description**                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Airmon-ng`   | Airmon-ng can enable and disable monitor mode on wireless interfaces.                                       |
| `Airodump-ng` | Airodump-ng can capture raw 802.11 frames.                                                                  |
| `Airgraph-ng` | Airgraph-ng can be used to create graphs of wireless networks using the CSV files generated by Airodump-ng. |
| `Aireplay-ng` | Aireplay-ng can generate wireless traffic.                                                                  |
| `Airdecap-ng` | Airdecap-ng can decrypt WEP, WPA PSK, or WPA2 PSK capture files.                                            |
| `Aircrack-ng` | Aircrack-ng can crack WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks that use pre-shared keys or PMKID.                          |

In the upcoming sections, we will go through each of these tools in detail.
